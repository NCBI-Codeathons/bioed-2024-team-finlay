# Project Summary
The goal of this project is to help students learn how vaccinations in general function by how antigen sequence/structure affects vaccine efficacy. This project is modular, to allow instructors flexibility in choosing the length of the project and the target audience. By choosing to do only 1 module or both modules, the project can be tailored to either introductory level undergraduate students or late-stage undergraduate students.

In Module 1, students will learn how the yearly influenza vaccine functions. Students will align the amino acid sequences of H1 hemagglutinin isoforms (the viral protein subtype used as a primary vaccine antigen) to find regions of conservation and variability, and then compare with H5 hemagglutinin (a subtype not included in vaccines). Students will further compare the protein structures of H1 and H5 to visualize how the amino acid sequence variability might affect protein structure, and how that influences vaccine effectiveness. 

In Module 2, students will dive deeper into the concept of antigenic drift, extrapolate on the knowledge from Module 1 to explore amino acid sequences and protein structures of several measles hemagglutinin proteins, and make the connection to why we do not require new measles vaccines periodically as we do for the flu.

# Curricular Package Details

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this course the student will be able to:
- List the steps involved in the replication of influenza viruses 
- Define what is a virus, a vaccine, antigenic drift, R0, herd immunity,
- Demonstrate use of R0 for H1N1 and H5N1
- Use NCBI Virus BLAST to compare sequences of different influenza viruses.
- Identify the variable sequences of the target proteins of influenza viruses.
