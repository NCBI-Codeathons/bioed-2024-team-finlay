# Project Summary
Briefly describe the developed curriculum package. Include the target audience (e.g., high school biology students) and highlight the NCBI resources used.

# Curricular Package Details
List the specific learning goals students will achieve with this curriculum.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this course the student will be able to:
- List the steps involved in the replication of influenza viruses 
- Define what is a virus, a vaccine, antigenic drift, R0, herd immunity,
- Demonstrate use of R0 for H1N1 and H5N1
- Use NCBI Virus BLAST to compare sequences of different influenza viruses.
- Identify the variable sequences of the target proteins of influenza viruses.


## Course Materials
Specify the resources developed, including lesson plans, activities, worksheets, presentations, etc. List file names, including file formats (e.g., .docx, .pdf).

## Assessments
Explain how student learning will be evaluated (e.g., quizzes, assignments, projects).

## Future Work
Optional section. Briefly mention any potential future development plans for the curriculum package.
