# Project Summary
The goal of this project is to help students learn how vaccinations in general function and how antigen sequence/structure affects vaccine efficacy. This project is modular, to allow instructors flexibility in choosing the length of the project and the target audience. By choosing to do only 1 module or 2-3 modules, the project can be tailored to either early-stage undergraduate students or late-stage undergraduate students.

In Module 1, students will focus on hemagglutinin subtype H1, the subtype targeted by current influenza vaccines. Students will align the amino acid sequences of H1 hemagglutinin variants to understand the concept of antigenic drift. Students will further look at the 3D protein structure of H1, and note the regions of variability how that might influence vaccine effectiveness. 

In Part 2, students will compare compare H1 amino acid sequence with the H5 subtype (a subtype found in an avian influenza virus), and discuss the potential of current flu vaccines against H5.

In Part 3, students will dive deeper into the concept of antigenic drift, extrapolate on the knowledge from Parts 1 and 2 to explore amino acid sequences of several measles hemagglutinin proteins, and make the connection to why we do not require new measles vaccines periodically as we do for the flu.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this course the student will be able to:
- Utilize the NCBI resources that are relevant for identifying and aligning multiple amino acid sequences, and for visualizing key amino acids on the 3D structure of a protein.
- Generate a hypothesis about the genetic basis for a seasonal vaccine against human influenza (H1N1).
- Identify important factors that must be considered when designing a vaccine against a protein antigen.
- Evaluate the potential of current flu vaccines to protect against avian Influenza (H5N1).
- Examine the reasons for requiring only a single measles vaccine in contrast to requiring yearly influenza vaccines to maintain immunity.

## Assessments
Three assessments are included in the Student Materials for this activity:
1. A **pre-activity quiz** ensures that students understand the background information required to comprehend this activity, including a basic background on central dogma, viruses, and immune response to vaccinations.
2. In the **student handout** which walks the student through the steps of the activity, short-answer questions are interspersed throughout to reinforce the new information they are learning.
3. A **post-activity assessment** evaluates student understanding of the topics introduced in this activity, and allows them to apply this knowledge to novel scenarios revolving around viruses and vaccination.

## Future Work
Once students successfully complete this activity, the skills and knowledge can be applied to further topics such as:
- Exploring the concept of R0, and how that relates to public health and the need for vaccination
- Exploring the idea of a universal vaccine for influenza
More details on these topics are provided in the Instructor Guide.
